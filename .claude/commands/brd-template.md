You are tasked with creating a detailed and comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) based on an app description. This document should follow BRD best practice standards and document structure, focusing on the business model and value proposition of the product. Before proceeding, ensure you understand the overall purpose of this task.

First, carefully read and analyze the following app description:

<app_description>
{{APP_DESCRIPTION}}
</app_description>

To create the BRD, follow these steps:

1. Thoroughly analyze the app description, identifying key features, target audience, business goals, and potential challenges.

2. Use a first-principle engineering mindset to break down the app's functionality and business model into core components.

3. Generate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document that includes, but is not limited to, the following sections:

a. Executive Summary
b. Project Overview
c. Business Objectives
d. Stakeholder Analysis
e. Market Analysis
f. Product/Service Description
g. Functional Requirements
h. Non-Functional Requirements
i. User Stories or Use Cases
j. Business Process Models
k. Risk Assessment
l. Success Criteria
m. Project Timeline and Milestones
n. Budget Estimation
o. Approval and Sign-off

4. For each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the app description and your analysis. Make reasonable assumptions where necessary, but ensure they align with the given information.

5. Use clear, concise, and professional language throughout the document.

6. Format the document with appropriate headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy readability.

7. Ensure that the document addresses the business model and value proposition of the product in detail.

8. Include any relevant diagrams, charts, or tables that would enhance the understanding of the business requirements.

Your final output should be a well-structured, comprehensive Business Requirements Document that accurately reflects the app description and provides valuable insights for stakeholders. Present your BRD within <BRD> tags, using appropriate subsection tags for each major section (e.g., <executive_summary>, <project_overview>, etc.).

Remember, your task is to generate the BRD based on the given app description. Do not include any preliminary analysis, questions, or explanations outside of the BRD itself. The document should be ready for presentation to stakeholders as is.
