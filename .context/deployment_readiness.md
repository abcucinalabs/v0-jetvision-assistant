- üî¥ No RLS = data leakage between tenants
- üî¥ No input validation = SQL injection risk
- üî¥ No rate limiting = DDoS/cost risk
- üî¥ No secrets in production = services won't connect
- üü† No HTTPS enforcement = handled by Vercel
- üü† No CORS = potential access issues

**Security Grade**: F (Major vulnerabilities)

## Deployment Recommendation

### ‚ùå DO NOT DEPLOY

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT DEPLOY** to production

**Reasoning**:
1. Application is non-functional (no backend)
2. Critical security vulnerabilities
3. Zero test coverage
4. No monitoring
5. Cannot process a single RFP request

### When Can We Deploy?

**Minimum Viable Deployment**:
- Week 5 (November 17-23) - If aggressive development
- Requires:
  - Database + Auth working
  - Core API endpoints
  - 1 working agent (Orchestrator)
  - Basic monitoring
  - 40%+ test coverage

**Full Production Ready**:
- Week 6 (November 24-30)
- All requirements met
- 80%+ test coverage
- Complete monitoring
- Security audit passed

---

## Staging Environment Recommendation

### ‚úÖ DEPLOY TO STAGING: Recommended

**When**: After Week 2 (November 3)
**Purpose**: Test integration before production
**Requirements**: Same as production but with test data

**Benefits**:
- Test real deployment
- Identify issues early
- Practice deployment process
- User acceptance testing

---

## Conclusion

**Current State**: 18% deployment ready
**Critical Blockers**: 30+ items
**Estimated Time to Ready**: 5-6 weeks

**Next Actions**:
1. Complete PREREQUISITES_CHECKLIST.md
2. Deploy database schema
3. Implement API routes
4. Configure environment variables
5. Review security checklist

**First Milestone**: Development environment fully functional (Week 1)
**Second Milestone**: Staging deployment (Week 3)
**Third Milestone**: Production deployment (Week 6)
