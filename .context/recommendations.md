# Recommendations and Next Steps

**Project**: JetVision AI Assistant
**Analysis Date**: October 20, 2025
**Planning Horizon**: 6 weeks (Oct 20 - Dec 1, 2025)

---

## Executive Recommendations

### 1. **Start Phase 2 Immediately** 🔴 URGENT

The project is 2 weeks behind schedule. Phase 2 (MCP Servers) should have started October 21. Beginning immediately can recover timeline.

### 2. **Parallel Development Required**

With 42 days to launch, sequential development is too slow. Recommend:
- Database + API routes (parallel track 1)
- MCP servers + Agent implementations (parallel track 2)
- Testing concurrent with development (continuous track)

### 3. **Focus on MVP First**

Full feature set may not be achievable. Prioritize minimum viable product:
- 1-2 core agents instead of all 6
- Basic authentication instead of full RBAC
- Manual fallbacks for some automation

---

## Alternative Approach: MVP-First

If timeline is too aggressive, recommend **MVP approach**:

### Phase A: Minimal Backend (Week 1-2)
- Database + Auth + 2 API routes
- Simple manual RFP workflow (no AI)
- **Delivers**: Working request management

### Phase B: Core Automation (Week 3-4)
- Orchestrator agent only
- Avinode integration only
- Manual quote analysis
- **Delivers**: Semi-automated workflow

### Phase C: Full Automation (Week 5-6)
- All remaining agents
- Complete automation
- **Delivers**: Full product

**Benefit**: Shippable product at each phase
**Risk**: May not meet full requirements

---

3. ❌ Optimize prematurely
4. ❌ Work sequentially
5. ❌ Ignore technical debt

### Key Decision Points

**Day 7 (Oct 27)**: Review Week 1 progress
- If database + 1 API working: Continue as planned
- If blocked: Reduce scope, focus on MVP

**Day 14 (Nov 3)**: Review Week 2 progress
- If MCP servers + APIs working: Continue as planned
- If blocked: Skip Gmail/Sheets, focus on Avinode only

**Day 21 (Nov 10)**: Review Week 3 progress
- If orchestrator agent working: Implement remaining agents
- If blocked: Ship with orchestrator only, manual analysis

**Day 28 (Nov 17)**: Go/No-Go Decision
- If core workflow works: Polish and deploy
- If not working: Extend timeline or ship reduced scope

---

## Conclusion

The project has **excellent architecture** but needs **aggressive implementation** to meet the December 1 deadline. Success is possible with:

1. Immediate start on backend implementation
2. Parallel development tracks
3. MVP-first mindset
4. Continuous testing

**Recommended First Action**: Deploy database schema today, create first API endpoint by end of week.

**Confidence in Timeline**: 65% with recommended approach, 90% with MVP approach
