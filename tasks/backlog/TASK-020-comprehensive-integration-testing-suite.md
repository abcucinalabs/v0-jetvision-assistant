## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### Phase 1: Red - Write Failing Tests

**Step 1**: Create test file structure
```bash
mkdir -p __tests__/integration
```

**Step 2**: Write comprehensive tests that fail initially

**Step 3**: Commit tests
```bash
git commit -m "test: add tests for comprehensive integration testing suite

Red phase - tests currently failing

Related to: TASK-020"
```

### Phase 2: Green - Implement Feature

**Step 1**: Write minimal code to pass tests

**Step 2**: Verify all tests pass

**Step 3**: Commit implementation
```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive integration testing suite

Green phase - tests now passing

Implements: TASK-020"
```

### Phase 3: Blue - Refactor

**Step 1**: Improve code quality

**Step 2**: Verify tests still pass

**Step 3**: Commit refactoring
```bash
git commit -m "refactor: improve comprehensive integration testing suite

Blue phase - refactoring complete

Related to: TASK-020"
```
