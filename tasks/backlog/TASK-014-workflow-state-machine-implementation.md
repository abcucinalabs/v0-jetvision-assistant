# TASK-014: Workflow State Machine Implementation

**Status**: ðŸ”µ Backlog
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours
**Assigned To**: Neo Agent
**Created**: October 20, 2025
**Due Date**: Week 3 of Implementation Plan

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Objective
Implement workflow state machine with 11 states and transition validation

### User Story
```
As a broker/developer
I want workflow state machine implementation
So that the system can handle RFP workflow efficiently
```

### Business Value
- Enables workflow state machine implementation
- Part of Week 3 deliverables
- Critical for production readiness

### Success Metrics
- âœ… State machine enforces valid transitions
- âœ… All 11 states implemented
- âœ… State history tracked in database
- âœ… Invalid transitions throw errors
- âœ… State can be rolled back

## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### Phase 1: Red - Write Failing Tests

**Step 1**: Create test file structure
```bash
mkdir -p __tests__/unit/api
```

**Step 2**: Write comprehensive tests that fail initially

**Step 3**: Commit tests
```bash
git commit -m "test: add tests for workflow state machine implementation

Red phase - tests currently failing

Related to: TASK-014"
```

### Phase 2: Green - Implement Feature

**Step 1**: Write minimal code to pass tests

**Step 2**: Verify all tests pass

**Step 3**: Commit implementation
```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement workflow state machine implementation

Green phase - tests now passing

Implements: TASK-014"
```

### Phase 3: Blue - Refactor

**Step 1**: Improve code quality

**Step 2**: Verify tests still pass

**Step 3**: Commit refactoring
```bash
git commit -m "refactor: improve workflow state machine implementation

Blue phase - refactoring complete

Related to: TASK-014"
```
