## 📋 Overview

The Proposal Analysis Agent evaluates and ranks quotes from operators using multi-factor scoring. It leverages GPT-5's advanced reasoning capabilities to provide intelligent recommendations based on price, quality, operator reputation, and client preferences.

### Responsibilities

- **Quote Evaluation**: Analyze operator quotes comprehensively
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Score quotes based on price, quality, reputation, client fit
- **Ranking & Recommendations**: Provide ranked list with justifications
- **Comparison Reports**: Generate side-by-side comparisons
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues with quotes

## 🛠️ Implementation

### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
interface ScoringFactors {
  price: number // 0-100 (inverse, lower is better)
  operatorRating: number // 0-100
  aircraftQuality: number // 0-100
  clientFit: number // 0-100 (match with preferences)
  reliability: number // 0-100 (on-time performance)
}

function calculateScore(quote: Quote, client: ClientProfile): number {
  const weights = {
    price: 0.35,
    operatorRating: 0.25,
    aircraftQuality: 0.20,
    clientFit: 0.15,
    reliability: 0.05,
  }

  const factors = analyzeQuote(quote, client)
  
  return Object.entries(weights).reduce(
    (score, [key, weight]) => score + factors[key] * weight,
    0
  )
}
```

### GPT-5 Analysis

```typescript
const analysis = await agent.run({
  context: {
    quotes: receivedQuotes,
    clientProfile,
    searchCriteria,
  },
  prompt: `Analyze these quotes and provide recommendations considering:
1. Overall value for money
2. Safety and reliability
3. Client preferences and history
4. Any red flags or concerns
5. Best options for different priorities (cheapest, best quality, fastest)`,
})
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Consider All Factors**: Don't just recommend cheapest option
2. **Explain Recommendations**: Provide clear justification
3. **Flag Risks**: Highlight any concerns with quotes
4. **Client-Centric**: Prioritize client preferences and history
